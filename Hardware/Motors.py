      Y = 6,     Coordinate system: 3 units: microns
      Z = Z,     Coordinate system: 1, moves the RTT stage up and down, units: microns

      Pitch = B, Coordinate System: 1, tilts the RTT stage towards left and right, i.e. Rotation around Y axis, units: degrees
      Rot = C,   Coordinate System: 2, rotation around Z axis, units: degrees

     All motions are in linear mode, i.e. slow, by default, unless specified explicitly otherwise.

     The position of motor i can be accessed at any time as:
