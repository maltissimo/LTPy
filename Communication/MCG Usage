The MCG class inside the Communication module is designed to take care of the SSH protocol that connects the host LTPy
computer to the Power PMAC controlling all the hardware on the QSYS Gantry.

Example usage:

1) init and open an interactive shell:

    myshell = Gantry()
    myshell.username = "myname"
    myshell.password = "mypassword"
    myshell.openssh()


2) send message and receive text outout
    #First method:
    message = "mymessage"
    myshell.send_message(mymessage)
    out = myshell.simple_output()

    #second method
    out = myshell.send_receive("mymessage")

3) close connection:

    myshell.close_connection()

Methods are provided to:
    open ssh connection as a terminal.
    close connection
    send messages down to the host
    listen to the output
    receive, format and display output in simple (i.e. one liner useful for further computation) and complex forms.
    initialize the pmac
    check connection status

The properties of the object are a minimal set allowing for connection both ways.

Username and password are to be provided by the user by appropriate methods.
IP is set to the loopback interface for safety ( and testing). Refer to the QSYS and Omron Manuals in the docs for
specifics
